## About [Home Solution](https://home-solutions-ih.web.app/)

* It is a Real Estate company's website.

* The `Home page `contains a navigation panel, banner section (included carousel slider), greetings user section, latest and top-rated projects of the company, top-rated apartments for sale and rent, testimonials, and footer section.

* The website has multiple routes, including `Home`, `Buy`, `Rent`, and a separate `dashboard` for users and admin.

* Users can register and log in using `email` and `password` and using `Google`.

* Logged In users can place an `order` to buy or rent their favorite apartments.

* Users can also manage their orders and write a review from `Dashboard`.

* An `admin` can Add a new apartment for `Rent` or `Sale`, Manage existing Flats, Manage any user's orders, and `make another user an Admin`.

* `React JS`, and `Bootstrap 5` are used to design the UI, `React Router v6` is used to manage routes, `Firebase` is used for authentication, `Express JS` and `MongoDB` are used to manage the `REST APIs` and manipulate database operation.

* I have used `Redux` for state management and APIs request handle.
